# orthogroup_extract_gene
This script processes the output from OrthoFinder to extract gene IDs from the Orthogroups.tsv file. It helps researchers identify which genes in a specific orthogroup belong to which species, which is essential for further evolutionary analysis such as gene family expansion or contraction.
